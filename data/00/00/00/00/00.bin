  |   One fine day a bunch of scientists created four tiny monsters. But    |
  |   for what? To test their cooperation skills of course! So they tied    |
  |   them together to a tiny monstrous chain and let them make their way   |
  |   through colourfull, tricky, cooperative experimental set-ups that     |
  |   only scientists can think up.                                         |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Anybody complained the plot is as flat as 2D? Bullseye! You are       |
  |   right. The unbelievable truth is: YOU are the monsters and WE are     |
  |   the scientists. Get tied to your friends and we will test your        |
  |   cooperation skills and creativity! And we will even test your         |
  |   friendship...                                                         |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Single players don't even have a chance to handle the monster's       |
  |   challenges. Also, it's a lot more fun to play with friends instead    |
  |   of playing alone, right?!? As a team you have to coordinate           |
  |   movement, jumps and cling to ground and walls to complete the         |
  |   levels and stay alive. That's not as easy as it sounds, but all the   |
  |   funnier! And every time your monstrous cooperative skills are not     |
  |   enough it will end up in great chaos - and great laughter.            |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Come on, subject, what about your friendship and cooperative          |
  |   skills?                                                               |
